            <h3>Egypt Unveils 3000-year old Lost city</h3>
            <p>Luxor: Archaeologists Saturday showed off their finds at what they say is the "largest" ancient city ever found in Egypt, dating to a golden age of the pharaohs 3,000 years ago.
            At the site near Luxor, home of the legendary Valley of the Kings, workers carefully carried ancient pots and showed human and animal remains dug up from the earth as members of the media toured around curved brick walls and rudimentary streets.

            "This is a large city that was lost. It was connected with the god Aton and Amenhotep III," famed Egyptologist Zahi Hawass enthusiastically told reporters Saturday.</p>

<h2><u>Things happening around the corner-</u></h2>

    <h3> A new venture in mollywood. <b>BARROZ</b> - Guardian of D’ Gama’s Treasure</h3> 
    <p>The sprouting of this story occurred four decades ago - year 1980 to be exact, when we were searching native fables and myths for making a children's film in 3D.<br>

​

The <i>Portuguese-Afro-Indian Myth</i> outlined here was just one among the many that were set aside when selecting the Kuttichathan Myth to narrate a children's fantasy.<br>

​

I did revisit the subject in 2003 when we were walking along Fort Kochi waterfront. Jude Attippetty pointed out a fascinating sight to me … some distance from the boat jetty, there was an man sitting atop a bollard. Then it occurred to me that this could be that ghost guarding his master's treasure in the <i>Portuguese-Afro-Indian Myth</i> ... as seen by an adolescent girl. I wrote the story and circulated it among a few friends.<br>


Kochi was in the excitement of the <b>Global Investor's Meet 2003</b> and hence the reason of my placing the story during a casino investors' meet in Goa. The casino is to come up at the very spot where the ghost was guarding the buried treasure. <br>

​

Rajeevkumar, who was in charge of the event management at the Kochi <b>Global Investor's Meet 2003</b>, pointed out the similarity of the new story with that of our earlier film <i>My Dear Kuttichathan</i>. Both are about a girl child befriending a treasure guarding spirit. I said to him "... so be it, but the child in the Kuttichatan myth has become an adolescent now in the <i>Portuguese-Afro-Indian myth</i>". Also, as the psychiatrists say, troubled adolescence is one cause for poltergeist activities in a neighborhood.<br>

​

Given here is a revised version of what I had originally written in 2003.
                                                                        <br>--Ridge

    <h3> Nvida enters the arms race with homegrown <q>Grace</q> cpu</h3>

    <p>There has been talk and cajoling and rumor for years that GPU juggernaut Nvidia would jump into the Arm server CPU chip arena once again and actually deliver a product that has unique differentiation and a compelling value proposition, particularly for hybrid CPU-GPU compute complexes. And today, at the GTC 2021 virtual conference, Nvidia co-founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang is going to announce just that by unveiling its “Grace” Arm server CPU effort.
